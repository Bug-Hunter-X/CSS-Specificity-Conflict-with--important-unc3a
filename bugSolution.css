Several approaches can resolve this specificity issue:

**1. Refactoring without `!important`:** The best solution is to refactor your CSS and avoid using `!important` if possible. This improves maintainability and readability.

**2. Using a more specific selector:** If refactoring isn't feasible, use a more specific selector that has higher precedence than the `!important` declaration.

**3. Strategically using `!important` (least recommended):** If other methods fail, carefully apply `!important` to the overriding selector. However, this is often discouraged due to its negative effects on maintainability.

Here's an example of a refactored solution that addresses the problem without using `!important`:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

```

This solution relies on the more specific selector `.parent .child` having natural precedence over the `.child` selector. In this revised code, the text will correctly be displayed in green.
