The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

```

In this example, we expect the `.parent .child` selector to override the `color: red !important` declaration in `.child`. However, due to the `!important` flag, the `color: red` declaration takes precedence. The seemingly simple solution of removing the `!important` flag might not be feasible in larger projects due to the complexity of CSS rules.  The issue stems from the specificity of selectors, where the `!important` declaration significantly impacts the expected behavior.
